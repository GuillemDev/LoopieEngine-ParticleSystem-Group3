## Particle System:
Our Particle System is based on the component ParticlesComponent. The Particle component holds a vector of EmitterInstances, which are tasked with keeping all necessary configurations, as well as the mesh, texture, and material needed to generate particles in the way determined by those configurations. When importing or exporting, we consider an array of emitters, each with its own configuration, stored in JSON format. If the user wants to modify any of the values, the component can be accessed through the inspector when selecting the entity owning it, allowing the user to modify any of the emitters in it.
